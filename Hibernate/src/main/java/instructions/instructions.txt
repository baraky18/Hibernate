Setup:
1. download the latest hibernate release bundle and put it in a hibernate folder in your PC.
2. download some DB (in my case postgresql). (user name: "postgres", password: "password", port: 5432)
3. download postgresql jdbc driver and add it to the project.
4. download the Postgresql folder to your PC. in my case it's located in: C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL.
5. to create the connection to the db we need to create a file with a specific name which is: "hibernate.cfg.xml" under resources folder 
   in our project. to fill this file, we need to go to hibernate folder and look for other files with the same name 
   and copy the content of one of them to the file that we created.
6. in the file that we created, modify DB connection settings and SQL dialect properties.
7. go to pgadmin (which is the postgresql admin) and create db with the same name that mentioned in the above file.
8. to make sure that DB will not be create each time I open a session and commit objects and thus delete all of the data I committed
   till that point, we need to go to the xml and change property hbm2ddl.auto to update. 

Add table and columns:
1. create a dto model (Object) and annotate the class with @Entity (from javax.persistence)
2. annotate one field as ID with @Id (from javax.persistence)
3. define this dto in hibernate.cfg.xml file under mapping element
4. create session factory that will create a session that will hold transaction that will save the dto and close the transaction
